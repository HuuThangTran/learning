you create a method for efficient and make it simple for you
you need a method to repeat that multiple time, call that method again and again 

drawsquare method declare receiving something it is call parameter
actual parameter: the integer that you input in the class (calling that method)
remember to input the local variables into the function

we can have the same name for different method ? 
#it is a case of overloading ?
#test in c pls
# what is class
# why is method in class ?



3 constructor with the same name but different input parameters

constructor can be consider as method (thang opinion)
class variables and instnace variables
