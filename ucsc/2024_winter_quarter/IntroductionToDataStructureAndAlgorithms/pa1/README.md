This is an ADT List data structure. The focus of this project is to create an Abstract Data Type (ADT) List structure in C. The primary objective is to develop an Integer List ADT that will be utilized to indirectly sort the lines in a file alphabetically.
The main program for this project will be called Lex.c. Your List ADT module will be contained in files called List.h and List.c, and it will export its services to the client module Lex.c.
The required List operations are specified in detail below. Lex.c will take two command line arguments giving the names of an input file and an output file, respectively.

Usage: Lex <input file> <output file>
