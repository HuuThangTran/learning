You should also include fields storing the number of vertices (called the order of the graph), the number of
edges (called the size of the graph), and the label of the vertex that was most recently used as source for
BFS. It is recommended that all arrays be of length ùëõ + 1, where ùëõ is the number of vertices in the graph,
and that only indices 1 through n be used. This is so that array indices can be directly identified with vertex
labels
