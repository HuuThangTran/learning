pa6: Arithmetic.cpp BigInteger.cpp BigInteger.h BigIntegerTest.cpp List.cpp List.h ListTest.cpp Makefile README.md Description: the top-level client called Arithmetic.cpp that uses the exported operations in BigInteger.cpp.
This client will read from an input file containing exactly 3 lines. It will parse the string on line 1 of the input file as a BigInteger, calling it A, read and discard line 2, then parse the string on line 3 as a BigInteger, calling it B. It will then compute the following quantities and write their base 10 digits (including a negative sign, if appropriate) to the output file.
