pa7: Dictionary.cpp Dictionary.h DictionaryTest.cpp Order.cpp Makefile README.md
Description: The main program Order.cpp will read in the lines of an input file, each line being a (unique) single string, then insert these strings (as keys) into a Dictionary. The corresponding values will be the line number in the input file where the string was read. The program will write two string representations of the Dictionary to the output file. The first string will consist of pairs of the form "key : value\n" so that when printed, each pair appears on its own line. The keys will be in alphabetical order. The second representation will consist of keys only, one to a line, with the order obtained from a pre-order tree walk.
